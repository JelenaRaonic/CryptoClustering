In this challenge, I used knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

The challenge consists of following parts:

1. Preparation of Data
2. Finding the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
4. Optimizing Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
5. Finding the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

The visualisation of the results is shown bellow(cluster analysis results by contrasting the outcome with and without using the optimization techniques).
